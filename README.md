# Monty Hall problem

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975 (Selvin 1975a), (Selvin 1975b).

## Question in the letter was :-

### Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

## Should you Switch?

The answer sounds unlikely. After door 3 is opened, you would think that you then have two doors to choose from…both with the same odds. However, you are actually much more likely to win if you switch.

Those who switched doors won about 2/3 of the time.

Those who didn’t switch won about 1/3 of the time.
